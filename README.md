## Hey there 👋

I’m **Apoorva**, a **4th-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Guelph** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity** and **engineering design**. I like building practical things, learning how systems behave in the real world, and using tech to support communities and meaningful work.

## What I’m focused on
I’m currently growing my skills in **security operations**, **threat awareness**, and **building tools that make workflows smoother and safer**.

## Experience snapshot
In my role with the **University of Guelph, Computing and Communications Services (CCS)** on the **Information Security** team, I worked on improving day-to-day security processes. I built and deployed **Microsoft Power Automate** workflows to streamline security operations, supported **cybersecurity incident handling** through the **FootPrints** system, and enhanced the **Threat Intelligence Feed Editor (TIFE)** by adding functionality that improved the efficiency of threat-data management. 

## Tools and tech
C/C++, Python, Java, Git, Linux  
Security and ops: Microsoft Power Automate, IBM QRadar, FootPrints
